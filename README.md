## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [postgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## Setting up the environment

Next you will need to create an ```.env``` file that has the following fields:
TMDBAPI={YOUR_API_KEY
TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN={YOUR_0AUTH2 BEARER TOKEN}

```TMDBAPI``` is a TMDB (similar to IMDB but has an API) api key that you will need to generate.

The ```TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN``` is needed to get the tweet data from twitter.  You will have to register for a developer account with twitter and then create an app.  These steps will explain further [https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access.html](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access.html)
